HPIO
====

HPIO is a library to manipulate GPIO pins for use on computers like the Raspberry Pi. It is not finished yet, and the first release aims at the following features:

- Easy to use interface
- Relatively high abstraction layer
- Testing environment (no actual GPIO capability is needed to run programs)
